# Hi there ðŸ‘‹,  my name is Adrian Prieto Villena

I am 28 years old and have been involved in the world of information technology for some time. My interest in application development began to grow as I delved deeper into this field. After graduating with a degree in video game development from Dypsela, a company specializing in AR and VR application development, I took my first steps in this area. To further my education, I enrolled in a program for Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), where I discovered my true passion. Currently, I am focused on developing applications using Swift, but my curiosity drives me to continuously learn new technologies.

## Goals

My goal is to continue growing as a mobile app developer, specializing in both native and cross-platform technologies. I'm excited to learn and collaborate on innovative projects that positively impact users.
